# Google Interview Practice â€” Curated Question Checklist

A practice-ready, topic-wise checklist of **commonly asked Google coding interview problems**. Use the checkboxes to track progress and add notes inline.

> Tip: Aim for **clean code + optimal complexity + clear communication**. For each solved problem, write a 3â€“5 line postmortem (pattern, pitfalls, optimal approach).

## How to Use This README
- Check âœ“ when you can **solve from scratch in 20â€“30 minutes**.
- Add a **Note** for gotchas (off-by-one, edge cases, data structure choice).
- Revisit items you marked `Revisit` after 48â€“72 hours.

**Legend:** `[ ]` = To do, `[x]` = Done, `(~)` = Revisit

## Practice Flow (Quick Reminder)
1. Clarify constraints & edge cases **out loud**.
2. Present a brute force; improve to optimal.
3. Code cleanly; test edge cases.
4. Analyze time/space; mention trade-offs.
5. Add a short postmortem in your notes.

Good luck â€” and be consistent. ðŸš€
